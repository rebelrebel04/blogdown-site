<p>This series is an exploration of a simple thought experiment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What if you regarded your body as a separate – even alien – organism, but one capable of communicating, learning, and adapting?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>How would you talk to this organism?</li>
<li>How would you listen to what it’s saying?</li>
<li>How could you try to teach it new things?</li>
</ul>
<p>Communicating, learning, and adapting are the hallmarks of what we call <em>cognition</em>, and the purpose of this thought experiment is to reorient your relationship to your body so that you view it not as a puppet whose strings you can pull at will (our default way of relating to our bodies), but as an independent organism with a mind of its own, one which communicates and learns in ways very different from how we typically think of “communicating” and “learning.”</p>
<p>Without understanding the different languages the body uses to communicate, attempts at training the body can be painfully inefficient, if not simply painful. Imagine trying to teach someone a movement as complicated as the clean and jerk by just saying one word over and over. It isn’t going to be effective: Your method of communicating is woefully inadequate for shaping such a complex behavior.</p>
<p>Of course, coaches and trainers have developed more effective techniques for teaching bodies how to perform complex movements, but this knowledge is scattered and not easily accessible to the average athlete, especially non-professionals. Understanding the various languages your body uses to communicate will demystify this knowledge and give you the tools to efficiently train your body.</p>

<h1>The Benefits of Speaking Your Body’s Languages</h1>
<p>With the explosion of interest in health and fitness over the past several years – to the point that ketogenic diets and kipping muscle-ups are now mainstream – there is also a need for an organizing vision to slot all of the new concepts and methods being discussed into a larger framework. After reading this book, you should feel sufficiently informed and empowered to make your own decisions about fitness goals and practices. The body languages perspective will help you understand not just what matters but why, so if you get into a debate about keto, you can build a well-grounded argument rooted in the body’s actual mechanisms and constraints. In addition, you will know how to tweak training programs to reach your goals as efficiently as possible, and with experience, be able to design effective training programs for yourself and others.</p>
<p>Yes, there really are different ways to communicate with your body, and yes, they really do have an impact on daily life: You can move around painlessly, feel fluid and flexible, feel rudely healthy, like your body was tuned by a master mechanic. Realizing that there are entire continents of knowledge about a subject – your own body – that you thought you knew well can be both jarring and thrilling. That’s a good reaction: I want you to be motivated to eradicate ignorance about your body, to reach out and take ownership of these awesome physical machines that we are each lucky enough to live within.</p>
<p>To put a finer point on it: We are not just brains driving around in meat-machines, like a man driving around in a mech suit. These “meat-machines” we live in live back. They exist within their own rich realities, they have their own goals and needs, and they influence the operation of our brains and cognition just as much as our brains influence them. For all you know, your body really is an alien creature – and you’re in a symbiotic relationship with this creature, so it would make sense to try and understand it.</p>
<p>Consequently, a major goal of this book is to help you learn how to engage in real, meaningful dialogue with your body. I’m going to push the analogy of having a conversation with this organism you exist within, and ultimately developing a sympatico relationship with it, so that you become attuned to its wants and needs and able to respond to them appropriately – not shouting when you should whisper, and not hammering away at a point when you should be listening instead. The radical notion here is to develop empathy for yourself, with a focus on empathizing with your body, so that you can converse with your body in languages it understands rather than simply trying to assert your ego’s desires and goals through sheer force of will. Empathizing with your body will unlock a new dimension of awareness about your body and deepen your relationship with it, by building a foundation of respect and appreciation. After reading this book, you should be motivated to care for your body and look to it as a partner in achieving your goals, rather than simply showering it with demands or insults in a one-way conversation.</p>
