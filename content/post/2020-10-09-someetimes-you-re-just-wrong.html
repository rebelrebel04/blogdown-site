<p><em>Or, My Mildly Over-the-Top Polemic on the Trump Phenomenon.</em></p>
<p>Let’s stipulate: There is a distribution of cognitive ability among humans, and some individuals, whether through genetics, upbringing, a lack of personal drive (or, in reality, some combination of all three) fall on the low end of the curve. They just aren’t smart, aren’t able to produce the same value as those further up the curve, and so they can’t compete in a meritocracy.</p>
<p><span class="hilite">Trump is the avatar for the anti-intellectuals’ revenge</span>. He is obviously a hollow, venal, emotionally stunted man-child, but that isn’t the point. Rather it’s the fact that he spurns everything that gives the bottom quartile fits: grit, a devotion to seeking the truth, learning, openness to change, empathy, embracing challenge, intellectual curiosity, and c. &amp; c. </p>
<p>It is, simply put, the revenge of those imbecilic, petty bullies from high school whom everyone knew would wash up or wash out because they couldn’t compete in society. And of course it’s kind of embarrassing for all concerned, because this isn’t polite to say out loud. But let’s say it: These people can’t cut it. We know it. <em>They</em> know it. Ineeded, it is precisely <em>because</em> they know it that they lash out with their anti-intellectual, blame-deflecting, xenophobic venom. It is no more complex than the eons-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanism">psychodrama of a fragile ego lashing out in self-defense</a>, terrified that others will discover its weakness. At a societal scale, where masses of such individuals aggregate and communicate, this private psychodrama manifests as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_personality">authoritarianism</a> – those most desperate to conceal their inner weakness are the most vocal in support of the strongman.</p>
<p>Now, the cosmically sad thing – not to say the deeply ironic thing – is that liberal / Democratic policy is specifically designed to accomodate the inevitable distribution of abilities within society: to help those who cannot help themselves. Watching the bottom quartile buy in to the conservative / Republican sink-or-swim, hyperindividualistic, “up by your boostraps” worldview is doubly depressing, since they are just setting a bar they already struggle to reach completely out of grasp. Their failure is effectively pre-ordained in this setup, and that’s all to the benefit of their manipulators (the plutocrats) because it results in endless, cross-generational cycles of failure: <strong>A grievance engine that the plutocracy has harnessed for their own ends, i.e., consolidating and maintaining power</strong>.</p>
<p>And here’s the kicker: Whether someone ends up in the bottom quartile or the top quartile of ability isn’t really a question of blame or credit – which is the opposite of the conservative / Republican worldview. Rather, it’s largely a question of happenstance (genetic and environmental, not to mention the opportunities society facilitates or witholds from an individual, typically based on the classes to which they belong).</p>
<p>And so it comes down to this: Sometimes people are just <em>wrong</em>. They don’t have a valid point. They don’t get it. They don’t have the cognitive tools to keep up, to provide value back to society. <em>And that’s ok</em>. It’s expected! They don’t have to suffer for it. But instead, they contort their lot in life into a list of grievances to throw back in the face of those who would try to help them.</p>
<p>It’s such a tragic, useless dynamic, ultimately reminiscent of the junky too proud to admit he has a problem and too self-involved to accept offers of help because of what it implies. But perhaps the analogy also suggests the solution: Interventions work when the junky admits he has a problem and recognizes that he can’t solve it alone; and more profoundly, that <strong>asking for and accepting help is not a sign of weakness but of strength</strong>. We as a society need the cognitive underclass to achieve this same insight. But I’m not sure how much longer the road will be to get there, since if we push the analogy further, it isn’t clear that they have hit rock bottom yet.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This post probably deserves a million caveats but perhaps the most important one is that, although cognitive ability is indisputably distributed unequally among the individuals within a population (just like any other trait), I flatly reject any contention that cognitive ability is correlated with the classes into which we habitually sort individuals: race, sex, socio-economic status, etc. There simply isn’t any empirical evidence for such correlations, and it is nothing but hateful invective to claim there is. Secondly, I should also make clear that not <em>all</em> individuals who fall into the “cognitive underclass” (i.e., the bottom range of the distribution of cognitive ability) behave the way I’ve described in this post; likewise, not <em>all</em> Trump supporters are at the bottom of that distribution. However, it seems clear that Trump’s so-called “base” is largely constituted by this peculiar phenotype of the grievance-driven anti-intellectual.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
