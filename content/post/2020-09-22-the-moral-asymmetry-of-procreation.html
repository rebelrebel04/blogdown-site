<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens">Modus tollens</a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Human reproduction is rationally unjustifiable (i.e., <em>if we were rational, then we wouldn’t reproduce</em>).</li>
<li>We continue reproducing.</li>
<li>Therefore, we are not rational.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a valid argument, and I take it (2) is self-evident<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, so the only way to avoid the conclusion (3) is to demonstrate that human reproduction is rationally justifiable. This is the premise I’m going to interrogate below.</p>
<div id="better-never-to-have-been" class="section level1">
<h1>Better Never to Have Been</h1>
<p>The clearest evidence that humans apply rationality only post-hoc, as justification of actions driven by their emotions, is the fact that we keep making more humans. If we were truly rational actors, we would stop reproducing, because on purely rational grounds there is no justification for making new humans. “Better never to have been” – the moral asymmetry of procreation. There is no harm in never having existed, but endless potential for suffering once a being exists. And no amount of pleasure or happiness experienced by that being can make up for the fact that any suffering experienced could have simply been obviated by never having come into existence in the first place.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-independence-of-experiences" class="section level1">
<h1>The Independence of Experiences</h1>
<p>Coherent units of experience (however that is measured) are fundamentally independent – i.e., there is no sense of dependence between any two moments, such that one moment “justifies” another. Humans foist these moral semantics onto what is, in reality, a collection of moments that has no inherent ordering of value – no one moment in time is inherently more or less valuable, or possesses more or less potential, than any other. Experiencing a lifetime of moments is essentially like scooping a handful of glass beads from an urn and laying them out in random sequence. There is no sense of one bead begetting another; they are simply and arbitrarily ordered as the arrow of time doles them out.</p>
</div>
<div id="experiences-cannot-be-weighed" class="section level1">
<h1>Experiences Cannot be Weighed</h1>
<p>Answer me this: why would you choose to bring a being into the world who can experience suffering? Suffering is hell, and there is no way to justify it, if only and ultimately because there is always the option to never have existed in the first place. Moreover, experiences are not the type of things that admit of justification or “counter-balancing” – it is a category error to say that a person’s positive experiences can “counter-balance” or “outweigh” their negative experiences, and in any case this is at best a gamble on the part of a parent: that the child will experience more pleasure than suffering. But even this line of thought betrays a misunderstanding in the use of the word “more”: pleasure and suffering are not quantitites to be toted up and compared; they are rather immeasurable qualities, true “apples and oranges” that cannot be compared because there is no scale or unit (sorry, “utils”) along which to measure them. An experience, whether pleasure or suffering, exists in and of itself, absolutely, independent of any other experience (cf. post: all moments are fundamentally of equal worth), and cannot in that moment be justified, mitigated, or otherwise qualified by any past or future experience.</p>
</div>
<div id="ugly-psychology" class="section level1">
<h1>Ugly Psychology</h1>
<p>If the syllogism holds: so what? At the very least, it means we should openly admit that we rely on rationality merely to post-justify actions driven by our emotions, rather than hypocritically claiming that rationality led us to behave as we did. In psychology, this is related to the phenomenon of post-decisional dissonance, “just world” behavior (blaming the victim), and many other mental contortions designed to protect our deep-seated commitment to a moral reality.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-individuals-declaration-of-independence" class="section level1">
<h1>The Individual’s Declaration of Independence</h1>
<p>///far from being selfish, as breeders view it, choosing not to have children may be the most unselfish choice a person can make: it is phylogenetic suicide, the ending of an unbroken line of procreating organisms that extends back to the origin of life on earth. It is the ultimate rejection of your evolutionary reason for existence, the ascendance of the individual consciousness over the genetic lineage (cf. Dawkins’ Selfish Gene hypothesis), and is, in its way, the individual’s declaration of independence. For, from the perspective of natural selection, the individual is fungible, and it is the genetic lineage that possesses identity. Fully rejecting this arrangement casts us into uncharted territory, a “post-evolutionary” world where individuals are the units of identity and genetic lineage is merely an accident of physiology. This is the root of the humanistic worldview, which not only rejects the view that individuals are fungible but actively asserts the opposite: that the individual is in fact the basic unit of meaning in the world. Thus, the negative choice to not have children can be recast as the positive choice to proclaim the sanctity of individuality, and more generally to advocate for a humanistic worldview.</p>
<p>The irony is not lost on me that, taken to its logical conclusion, anti-natalist humanism would eventually yield a world without humans. But that strikes me as neither a contradiction nor a negative consequence – indeed, given the moral asymmetry of procreation outlined above, <a href="http://www.vhemt.org/">voluntary extinction</a> would seem to be the only justifiable course of action for moral beings living in an amoral world.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The declining birthrates in “developed” countries might be brandished as a counter-example here, but my argument does not hinge on empirical rates of reproduction (and, in particular, whether or not they fall below replacement rate); my claim is stronger in that the only rational choice for an individual human, when considering the moral tradeoffs, is to <em>not</em> create a new human life – not merely to slow the rate of reproduction, even if this were eventually to culminate in human extinction.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
