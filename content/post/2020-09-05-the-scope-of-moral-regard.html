<h1>The Scope of Moral Regard</h1>

<h2>Level 2</h2>
<p>How do we draw the boundary around the scope of our moral regard – the interests we concern ourselves with vs. not?</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-05-the-scope-of-moral-regard_files/scope%20of%20moral%20regard.png" /></p>
<p>Stipulation: drawing the scope too wide is inimical to mental health; or, IOW, a necessary condition of mental health / happiness is to limit the scope of one’s moral regard. There is a direct correlation between how many things you care about and your wellbeing (or, conversely, anxiety).</p>
<p>In gradient problems like this it’s useful to stake out the extremes, so we at least know what we’re working between…</p>
<p>If there is no principled way to do this, then it seems that happiness is arbitrary, in that it requires drawing an unjustified boundary around one’s moral regard. More likely, we just leave this to chance and exploit the “ignorance is bliss” lemma.</p>
<p>However: just because there is no bright line / principle defining a breakpoint does not mean it is not sensible to talk of qualitatively distinct conditions. Famously: when does a balding man become bald? In this case: when does a concern become so extrinsic to an individual as to be considered qualitatively outside the scope of that individual’s moral regard?</p>
<p>The Stoic answer to this (Euripides???) is to care only about the affairs over which you have control and not care about the rest. However, this has always struck me as a paradigm example of begging the question: <em>Ok, but how do you accurately discriminate between the affairs over which you do vs. do not have control?</em> So we’re back to the question of drawing the scope of moral regard, and Stoicism doesn’t seem to offer any help yet.</p>

<div id="the-moral-asymmetry-of-procreation" class="section level1">
<h1>The Moral Asymmetry of Procreation</h1>
<p>modus ponens:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no rational justifiation for reproducing. (if we were rational, then we wouldn’t reproduce)</li>
<li>we continue reproducing.</li>
<li>therefore, we are not rational.</li>
</ul>
<p>The clearest evidence that humans apply rationality only post-hoc, as justification of actions driven by their emotions, is the fact that we keep making more humans. If we were rational-first creatures, we would stop reproducing, because on purely rational grounds there is no justification for making new humans. “Better never to have been” – the moral asymmetry of procreation There is no harm in never having existed, but endless potential for suffering once a being exists. And no amount of pleasure or happiness experienced by that being can make up for the fact that any suffering experienced could have simply been obviated by never having come into existence in the first place.</p>
<p>Answer me this: why would you choose to bring a being into the world who can experience suffering? Suffering is hell, and there is no way to justify it, if only and ultimately because there is always the option to never have existed in the first place. Moreover, experiences are not the type of things that admit of justification or “counter-balancing” – it is a category error to say that a person’s positive experiences can “counter-balance” or “outweigh” their negative experiences, and in any case this is at best a gamble on the part of a parent: that the child will experience more pleasure than suffering. But even this line of thought betrays a misunderstanding in the use of the word “more”: pleasure and suffering are not quantitites to be toted up and compared; they are rather immeasurable qualities, true “apples and oranges” that cannot be compared because there is no scale or unit (sorry, “utils”) along which to measure them. An experience, whether pleasure or suffering, exists in and of itself, absolutely, independent of any other experience (cf. post: all moments are fundamentally of equal worth), and cannot in that moment be justified, mitigated, or otherwise qualified by any past or future experience.</p>
<p>If the syllogism holds: so what? At the very least, it means we should openly admit that we rely on rationality merely to post-justify actions driven by our emotions, rather than hypocritically claiming that rationality led us to behave as we did. In psychology, this is related to the phenomenon of post-decisional dissonance</p>
<p>///far from being selfish, as breeders view it, choosing not to have children may be the most unselfish choice a person can make: it is phylogenetic suicide, the ending of an unbroken line of procreating organisms that extends back to the origin of life on earth. It is the ultimate rejection of your evolutionary reason for existence, the ascendance of the individual consciousness over the genetic lineage (cf. Dawkins’ Selfish Gene hypothesis), and is, in its way, the individual’s declaration of independence. For, from the perspective of natural selection, the individual is fungible, and it is the genetic lineage that possesses identity. Fully rejecting this arrangement casts us into uncharted territory, a “post-evolutionary” world where individuals are the units of identity and genetic lineage is merely an accident of physiology. This is the root of the humanistic worldview, which not only rejects the view that individuals are fungible but actively asserts the opposite: that the individual is in fact the basic unit of meaning in the world. Thus, the negative choice to not have children can be recast as the positive choice to proclaim the sanctity of individuality, and more generally to advocate for a humanistic worldview.</p>
<p>The irony is not lost on me that, taken to its logical conclusion, anti-natalist humanism would eventually yield a world without humans. But that strikes me as neither a contradiction nor a negative consequences – indeed, given the moral asymmetry of procreation outlined above, <a href="http://www.vhemt.org/">voluntary extinction</a> would seem to be the only morally justifiable course of action for moral beings living in an amoral world.</p>

<h1>Category Errors: The Cardinal Sin of Sense-Making</h1>
<p>The root cause of most of our frustrations is forcing a mental model onto an event that doesn’t fit. That is, we make category errors. Religion is a paradigm example of this, whereby humans force the concept of morality onto natural events, when natural events are simply (and indeed, by definition) not the types of things to which morality applies. <em>Morality is a human construct</em>, and it does not exist independently of our own supposition. Put differently, in the absence of human existence, morality would not exist. The concept of morality hinges on the concept of free choice (“ought implies can”) and free choice, in the sense intended here – of volition in the face of conceived alternative consequences – does not exist in nature. [FN: An argument can be made that this concept of free choice is continuous rather than binary: e.g., to the extent that ravens can conceive of the concequences of alternative actions, they exercise volition when executing one of those actions, and therefore are subject to a proto-moral sense of responsibility for having so chosen; this is the thrust of Dennett’s “freedom evolves” thesis: that the more readily you can conceive of alternative consequences to your actions, the more opportunities you have to choose, and hence more freedom.]</p>
<p>The point is that generally speaking, religion is an attempt to force natural events to conform to a moral frame of reference, which is simply a category error. Among other things, this deflates the motivation for theodicy, because the fact that “bad things happen” (whether or not to good people) is already a mistaken formulation: <em>things</em> – in the sense of natural events or happenstance – are neither good nor bad; it simply makes no conceptual sense to ascribe natural events a moral quality, just as it makes no conceptual sense to ascribe natural events a mood. There is no such thing as “angry weather”, although the mixing of mental models in this way can produce colorful figures of speech – hence the generative power of analogy and metaphor; but it is still a mistake to reify a metaphor that mixes mental models. This is a particularly easy trap to fall into, because metaphor is such a powerful mode of understanding the world: by extending a known mental model onto a new phenomenon, we can immediately gain some understanding – and control – over it. But whether or not that mental model is actually <em>explanatory</em> with respect to the new phenomenon, or merely heuristically predictive, is an empirical question, and in some ways this is just the purpose of science: to validate which of many alternative mental models (aka explanations, hypotheses, etc.) applied to a phenomenon is the most accurate. And it is just in the ruling out of the existing mental models that we are forced to branch out (orthogonally, as it were) to form <em>new</em> mental models, as famously as occurred in the bifurcation of physics into classical and quantum (what Kuhn popularized as “paradigm shifts”). Probing an analogy for its points of failure is perhaps the surest way to forge new conceptual ground, because these failures eventually force us to construct new cognitive tools – mental models – to explain the data.</p>
<p>So many of our emotional hangups boil down to category errors, yet they are difficult to move past because the error is baked into one’s frame of reference, rather than being observable within it – and hence cannot be resolved within it. The solution is objectively obvious but subjectively invisible: to change the frame you use to understand a situation so that you are not ascribing conceptually inapplicable qualities to the event in question. Natural death is happenstance and does not admit of any sense of “fairness” or “justice.” Perhaps the cardinal sin of category errors, the one responsible for vast amounts of self-inflicted suffering, is the dogged belief that the world is just. People will engage in tortuous mental gymnastics to preserve this core belief, and it may even be the driving motivation behind religious belief itself: after all, the world only requires being made sense of if you assume that there is any sense to the order of natural events in the first place. Religious belief springs from the desire to make sense of natural events using a moral framework; conversely, science springs from the desire to make sense of natural events using a rational/empirical framework. The difference is compounded by the choice of sense-making machinery: mysticism (faith in hidden powers) vs. mechanism (evidence for causal connections).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in both cases the adherent assumes that natural events have an “order” that admits to “being made sense of.” Here we are drilling down to the bedrock of sanity, because if we forego this assumption – that the events we collectively experience as <em>our lives</em> have some kind of underlying order, sequence, or interconnection – the alternative is to view the world and our lives as chaotic, fundamentally unexplainable, and impossible to make sense of. Our brains balk at this reflexively out of self-preservation, because embracing this belief would undermine every tenet of mental health, precluding any concept of agency or security, much less well being.</p>
<p>Interestingly, for nearly anyone who has experienced the death of a loved one, it becomes immediately obvious that cognitively accepting that the world is not just (nor unjust) has virtually no bearing on one’s emotional response to that death. This, I take it, is simply one more example of the fact that emotion acts independently of rationality, and cannot be controlled by it; and further, that our emotions are hardwired to respond within a moral frame of reference, as evidenced by the deep suffering we instictively attribute to the “unfair,” “unjust,” or “undeserved” death of a loved one. It is said that “humans are moral creatures” and this may be the kernel of truth there – that by evolving to rely on cooperation as our fitness advantage, we have baked a moral lens into our perception of the world, and perhaps for that reason are so ready to over-attribute agency and morality to natural events, while at the same time failing to recognize that none but human actions properly admit of being evaluated through a moral lens.</p>
