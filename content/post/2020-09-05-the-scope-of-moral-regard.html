<p>How do we draw the boundary around the scope of our moral regard – the interests we concern ourselves with vs. not?</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-05-the-scope-of-moral-regard_files/scope%20of%20moral%20regard.png" /></p>
<p>Stipulation: drawing the scope too wide is inimical to mental health; or, IOW, a necessary condition of mental health / happiness is to limit the scope of one’s moral regard. There is a direct correlation between how many things you care about and your wellbeing (or, conversely, anxiety).</p>
<p>In gradient problems like this it’s useful to stake out the extremes, so we at least know what we’re working between…</p>
<p>If there is no principled way to do this, then it seems that happiness is arbitrary, in that it requires drawing an unjustified boundary around one’s moral regard. More likely, we just leave this to chance and exploit the “ignorance is bliss” lemma.</p>
<p>However: just because there is no bright line / principle defining a breakpoint does not mean it is not sensible to talk of qualitatively distinct conditions. Famously: when does a balding man become bald? In this case: when does a concern become so extrinsic to an individual as to be considered qualitatively outside the scope of that individual’s moral regard?</p>
<p>The Stoic answer to this (Euripides???) is to care only about the affairs over which you have control and not care about the rest. However, this has always struck me as a paradigm example of begging the question: <em>Ok, but how do you accurately discriminate between the affairs over which you do vs. do not have control?</em> So we’re back to the question of drawing the scope of moral regard, and Stoicism doesn’t seem to offer any help yet.</p>
