- The Question of Principles
	- Principles are good until they aren’t
	- Lacking principles is either “inconsistent and hypocritical” or “adaptive and resilient” depending on how you spin it
	- The trick with principles is that they have to be somewhere between universal (which won’t work because it makes you completely inflexible… “might break but will never bend”… white-knuckling through life) and completely non-existent (“arbitrary and capricious” — a real flake)
		- Essentially the idea is that you need context-sensitive principles: not principles that cut across situations but principles that adapt to changing circumstances. Whether or not these are still principles is semantic. The point is to find a middle way between iron inflexibility and flaky unreliability.
